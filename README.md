# Random Password Generator
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how javascript can be used to genertate a (pseudo)random password.
In the web application, once it a user clicks on the "generate password" button:
The user will be asked for the length of their wanted password, a number from 8 to 128;
Then, the user will be given options for what to include in their password. At least one option needs to be choosen.
Finally, a password will be generated and written in the "Your Secure Password" field.
