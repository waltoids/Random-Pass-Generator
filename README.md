# Random Password Generator
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how javascript can be used to genertate a (pseudo)random password.
In the web application, once it a user clicks on the "generate password" button:
The user will be asked for the length of their wanted password, a number from 8 to 128; script will validate user's choice to make sure it is a proper length.
Then, the user will be given options for what to include in their password. At least one option needs to be choosen, the script will validate that an option was choosen.
Finally, the script will generate a random password using the length and options choosen. A password will be generated and written in the "Your Secure Password" field.
